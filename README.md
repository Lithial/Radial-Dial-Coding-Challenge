# Radial Dial Coding Challenge

This project was done as the pre interview coding challenge for Circl.es.

The design for the challenge looked like this.

For this project I was instructed to use React and supplied with the two SVG used as Icons.

My choice for this project was to use sass to handle my styling but because I needed some elements to have procedural 
styling I used a combination of Sass and JSS.
